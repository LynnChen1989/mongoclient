# Roadmap

The roadmap is likely that priorities will change, but the list below gives an idea about next planned features.

## Planned Features

- Adding extension framework to make implementing new features easier to nosqlclient for newbies. That means there'll be an addon section on mongoclient. 
- Change blaze template to REACT.
- [x] Move to ES6
- [x] Move to Flow router
- [x] Move to Meteor 1.4+
- [x] Native shell
- [x] Schema Analyze
- [x] Simple query wizard
- [x] Improving dump/restore section to make it more usable. Currently it's experimental.
- [x] A migration tool for version transitions of nosqlclient. (Import connections, dumps, settings from an older version)
- [x] Writing a brief documentation about contributing and using nosqlclient and more. 

Apart from these, all open issues, include upcoming enhancements or bug-fixes to be implemented
